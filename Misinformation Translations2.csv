"What is blood treatment with cough?
===========================
Winter means more or less the nuisance of cough in the house. Blood can come out with phlegm when coughing for many reasons. And bleeding does not mean neglecting the problem at all. Many such problems can be solved if treated at the right time. Rayganj Super Specialty Hospital TB Unit Medical Officer Dr. Debbrat Roy.
It is normal to be alarmed when you see blood with coughing. Coughing up or sputum with blood – the dress code of which is hemoptysis. This problem really creates panic in the life of the individual. In old literature and movies, blood gushing out of the mouth was used to show that someone had TB or tuberculosis. It started from there. Then we assume that coughing up blood is a sign of TB or Tuberculosis. It's better not to always see the problem that way"
"#When treating bronchitis, homeopathy treatment is very effective. In fact, it is considered to be the most promising treatment for bronchitis. Homeopathic medicines work as a very reliable and safe treatment to get rid of bronchitis. There are no side effects of this treatment. It has been proven that colds accumulated in mucous membranes can be easily removed by homeopathy treatment. With the help of properly selected homeopathic medicines, colds can be easily removed, cough, chest pain and difficulty in breathing can be reduced and the suffering is almost over."

"""Is #women's #ejaculate like men's ❓
There are special glands on both sides of the vagina of women, during orgasm, a kind of liquid juice is released from this gland, which wets the entire vagina and makes it slippery, as a result, it is convenient for the man's penis to penetrate deep into it. This gland is visible from the outside, covered with skin.
But vaginal discharge is directly visible to the eye.
This juice is not secreted all the time. Bartholin's gland produces this juice only when there is strong arousal. A type of liquid juice is secreted during the first stage of male orgasm, like female ejaculation. Many people have a misconception that the juice contains spermatozoa. In fact, their idea is wrong.
There is no sperm in that juice. Again, the ovum has nothing to do with this commerce of the female body. However, it is not necessary to speak in support of each other.
Many people say, at the end of the night, does semen ejaculate from the vagina of a woman like a man? In short, the answer is no. Girls do not ejaculate.
Their semen is ovum.
However, the reason for this in people's minds is that when they have the desire to have sex or are inclined to have sex, especially as a result of male sexual intercourse, semen is released from their vagina, many people mistakenly assume that the juice is sperm or semen.
And this kind of juice-secretion also comes out from the male penis. In the female body, this rasa is more or less present as long as there is tension.

"""Men's ideas about #sex!
When a male is aroused he thinks he will perform very well, but when it comes to intercourse, his true performance can be seen. Good copulation but for a woman that time becomes very painful. Then the woman has no choice but to cry. # How can a wife get happiness if she has not ejaculated.
What the woman wanted was that if she had intercourse for some more time, she would feel great and ejaculate.
No boy wants to believe or know that girls ejaculate, in our country. But the truth is that girls also ejaculate.
And that's why if we eat the power source herbs then our time will be 8 to 10 minutes more, it can be seen that both of us can spend the time very peacefully.
By doing this, the ejaculation of both can be enjoyed beautifully.

Calm and healthy environment
Attract a partner with words
Adequate caress to partner (kissing, caressing, sucking, etc.)
Prolonged copulation
Lying down hugging the partner after copulation
Whether the partner is satisfied or not will be revealed in the eyes. You will get an idea if you notice if your partner is making shitkar (aww sound during intercourse) during intercourse.

"""All grown men should read the writings. If you don't have time, share it and make time to read it‼️
🛑 Looking for permanent treatment,,,, and want to spend ⁉️ like weekly raw market❗
🛑 What will happen then ❓ will not...
Looking for cheap good things, a class of businessmen are showing flashy ads, in front of you! Advertising, only one file is enough, the price will be refunded in case of failure ❗
🟠 You might be thinking at that time I got this‼️ Last treatment of life❗ Who is stopping me❗ You are happy and the seller is happy❗ You are happy to get the product cheaply❗ And the seller is happy to get a product like you (stupid)❗ Don't take these words personally, I am saying this to hurt someone. No
❎ Well someone tell me if one file is enough for anyone⁉️
I don't know... You may have been a king as long as you drank, and after drinking you became a subject.
Why does this happen?
🚫 Because, by mixing excessive chemicals in that medicine, it artificially increases the sexual power by releasing hormones from the pituitary gland of your brain.
  🚫 Artificially torturing the body causes the bar of your special organ to ring ❗ The special organ loses its own activation ❗
🚫 After being cheated, he abused the medicine seller for a few days and again fell into the trap of some other flashy advertisement❌
  ⛔ This is how your pony horse works! You are moving, money is going, time is also going.
❎ I will not directly blame those drug sellers! The fault is that you find good things cheap. Expensive disease treatment is never cheap, expensive disease treatment has to be done with price❗
⛔ You believe and do not! They have hacked your mind!
They understand what you want. And because they understand, they give you flashy ads, they understand your needs and provide cheap products. And your needs are followed by eating results
🅿️ Set the thought a little, read my words carefully❗
🔰 You go to the doctor with a general bad body or stomach/headache - you spend thousands of rupees on doctor's fees, various tests, medicines. And when you treat an important part of the body, look for cheap. Cheap is not always good, cheap has three conditions❗
🚫 There are basically two types of sexual problem patients in the society
👉1/ Suffering from sexually transmitted diseases, but did not take any treatment.
👉 2/ Suffering from sexual dysfunction, has taken many over the counter medicines.
✅ Stage 1 people are much better than stage 2 people. Reason- Being sick is one problem and taking harmful medicines along with being sick is a double problem❗
🛑 Many people may say, brother, I don't take medicine cheaply, I took it at a high price. But it didn't work
There are two reasons behind it not working, if you buy the medicine at a price, it will not be a chemical free healthy herbal product. It takes 5 days/ 7 days or up to 15 days to see results in herbal medicine
And every herbal treatment has a specific course, you have to complete the course by following the rules
⛔ It takes some time to heal the pain that people get when their feet slip even while walking. And you want a permanent solution, but don't be patient! It won't happen‼️You have to be patient❗
❎ There are no shortcuts in life. To get some things, you have to wait for a certain time
🛑 When a tall building is constructed, piling has to be done and after the piling is completed one has to wait for many days to build the superstructure. Buildings cannot be built overnight only if money is available. We have to wait for the foundation of the building to be strong
🔰 To get permanent solution you have to patiently take the medicine regularly❗
🌿 To get permanent solution you need to take any herbal doctor or herbal kabiraj medicine 🍀
❎ Just stay hundreds of miles away from salespeople. Because, those who are only drug sellers have no responsibility, they will try their best to sell drugs to you by telling the truth or lying about themselves.
🌿 But on the other hand, herbalists have a lot of responsibility, they can't play tricks on you easily if they want to. And because their medicines are made of original organic plants, the quality is good enough.

"""What is white discharge❓❓❓
✅ Watery, slippery, transparent white substance that comes out of the female vagina. It is a normal discharge from the uterus and vagina that contains dead cells and some bacteria. It is a type of acid (unpurified) secretion❗
✅ Normal discharge:
Such discharge is very normal and necessary from the body of any healthy woman. The vagina is an important part of the female body because,
👉(1) It is a sexual organ, it is directly used in intercourse.
👉(2) It is a reproductive organ, through which the baby is born.
👉(3) There is direct external communication with abdominal cavity through this tubular organ❗
🔰 Therefore, the risk of vaginal infection is high and it can spread to the abdominal cavity and pose a serious threat to life. Normal white discharge plays an important role in maintaining the health of this organ, keeping it functional and preventing infections in the abdominal cavity.
🔰The amount of menstrual flow can vary at different times of a woman's life. A little extra discharge is so normal at certain times, such as during sexual desire or excitement, ovulation (mid-menstrual period), before and after menstruation, pregnancy and new baby girls, that it indicates the health of your sexual and reproductive health. However, it is important to maintain the normal quality of this discharge, otherwise it may turn into abnormal discharge
☪️ Abnormal discharge:
Discharge that feels uncomfortable such as;
👉1. Profuse discharge that makes clothing, petticoats, pajamas or panties very wet.
👉2. Itching of vagina and surrounding area with discharge.
👉3. Discharge is foul-smelling.
👉4. The discharge is brown, green, yellow, or thick whitish, instead of clear white, liquid, and slimy.
👉5. Liquid matter like foamy white or rice washing water comes out❗etc.

Let's start from the side for which it has so many names
# Improves sexual performance
For a long time, ginseng has been used to improve sexual function and libido in men as well as women. In China, this herb is considered an aphrodisiac.
Korean red ginseng is especially helpful for erectile dysfunction patients and this herb helps in about 60% of cases. Women can benefit from this herb for unwanted menopausal symptoms such as fatigue, insomnia, anxiety, depression, and low libido. Key to ginseng's utility as a sexual health support herb is its ability to combat stress, help promote healthy blood circulation (in men and women), and its contribution to physical stamina is undeniable.
#Prevents virus infection
Research shows that ginseng acts as an ""adaptogen"". Ginseng prolongs life by fighting Pseudomonas aeruginosa and viral infections. Studies continue to support ginseng's protective role against anticancer drugs and treatments and its ability to combat the side effects of chemotherapy. Also, ginseng is used to prevent abuse and dependence on psychostimulants and opioids.
#Reduces cholesterol and blood sugar
In addition to protecting against colds, flu, and some forms of cancer, Korean ginseng has been shown to reduce cholesterol and blood sugar levels in clinical studies. Thus, the herb can help treat high cholesterol and type 2 diabetes. However, other potential uses of ginseng have not been defined. In separate studies in humans and laboratory animals, Panax ginseng produced a relaxing effect on the lung muscles. This can help relieve asthma symptoms and other lung conditions.
# Anti-aging works
Korean red ginseng contains anti-acidifying properties such as antioxidants and insulin-like substances that are not found in any other type of ginseng. It helps provide blood flow to the body's internal organs, through capillaries that normally constrict as we age, allowing for better physical performance and organ health.
#Protects against cancer
It has anti-tumor properties and provides protection against certain types of cancer such as stomach, ovarian, pancreatic, liver and lung cancer. Smokers taking ginseng have a lower risk of common cancers associated with smoking than non-smokers. Ginseng provides better outcomes for breast cancer patients such as better quality of life and survival rates. The herb increases the energy of cancer patients as well as awakens their appetite.
# Increases endurance and strength
One of the benefits of ginseng is that it increases energy. The herb has been renowned for increasing stamina and strength for hundreds of years. Korean ginseng is beneficial for healthy individuals who want to increase their physical performance as well as those suffering from any disease-related fatigue. The mental energy boosts provided by ginseng are mild, unlike those provided by coffee. It doesn't crush or annoy you. It has been shown to reduce fatigue and increase energy in cancer patients. Ginseng is also a useful herbal remedy for Chronic Syndrome (CFS). It has been equally effective in unexplained chronic fatigue.
#Reduces stress
Ginseng works to both relax and stimulate the nervous system. It increases capillary circulation in the brain and reduces stress effects.
#Improves mental performance and memory
Ginseng acts as a brain protector and booster. It can boost your mental performance and concentration. As it is an antioxidant, it protects vulnerable brain cells from free radical damage. Moreover, it protects against memory loss and age-related mental degeneration.
Taking Panax ginseng root regularly for 12 weeks can improve mental performance in Alzheimer's disease patients. Korean ginseng improves memory in stroke patients. When ginkgo biloba and ginseng are combined in brain supplements, a synergistic effect is created, resulting in improved short-term memory as well as reduced ADHD symptoms.
#Ensures mental health
#Helps kick bad habits
Panax ginseng provides withdrawal from a variety of addictive substances, from nicotine to morphine"

   🍊Works as a scrubber to remove dead skin.
   🍊Orange peel is effective for open pores problem.
   🍊 Helps to bring shine to the nails.
   🍊Helps reduce skin wrinkles.
                      🍊Usage process🍊
🍊For glowing skin:
Orange peel powder + turmeric powder + honey
Make a paste and apply it for 10-15 minutes. Then wash off. You can use this pack twice a week.🍊
🍊For dry skin:
Orange peel powder + raw milk
Make a paste and apply it for 10-15 minutes. Then wash off. You can use this pack twice a week 🍊
🍊 Soak the orange peel in water overnight and wash your hair with that water in the morning. It will do three things—clean hair, remove dandruff and soften hair.🍊
Don't do that
Discard the orange peel if you plan to refrigerate it. Quality will decrease.
Do not leave orange peels dry for long. Fungus can grow.
Do not go in the sun for a while after using orange peel or pack. The skin will get sunburned. Those who have very sensitive skin, allergies should refrain from using it

"""A few words about bush-blowing and #tabij-charms
In fact, #Allah Ta'ala has given instructions for curing diseases as well as diseases. Some of these measures are direct. For example, black cumin, honey etc. and various medicines prepared in various ways. Again some systems are indirect. For example, du'a-darood mentioned in the hadith regarding freedom from diseases and dangers.
Taking these measures in case of illness and danger is not against Tawakkul. Rather, according to the commentary of the hadith, it is sunnah to make du'a and take food. As such, medicine can be used freely during illness.
And the ruling on accepting amulets is that it is fundamentally permissible. In addition to the deeds and fatwas of the Companions, the legality of using amulets has been described from Mujahid, Ibn Sirin, Ata Ibn Abi Rabah and other Tabees. Note Musannaf Ibn Abi Shayba for narrations. From these descriptions it is clear that the use of amulets was prevalent during the period of Sahaba-Tabeyyid. And the amulets that are forbidden in the hadith are essentially polytheistic amulets.
It should be noted that there are a few points to be noted regarding the use of talismans:
1. Not to go for amulets to an ignorant person or a non-Muslim who does not know the Qur'an and Hadith.
2. Words of the Qur'an-Hadith or the Names and Attributes of Allah. Not to be Shirk or anything contrary to Shariah.
3. Be fluent in Arabic or other languages. Not to be vague and unintelligible.
4. The belief is rooted that amulets have no power of their own. Health, freedom from danger and fulfillment of needs are all by the command of Allah.
5. Do not give more importance to amulets than dua and deeds described in Quran and Hadith.
If one can use the talisman following these conditions, then there is no problem. But most of the time it is seen that common people cannot accept these conditions. As a result, Shirk infiltrated their beliefs.
That is why Maulana Ashraf Ali Thanvi. He said, it is better not to do it, even if it is permissible to blow dust, amulets and charms. Elsewhere, he says, if amulets cause error in public belief, they will be prohibited from adopting this means. However, it is best to avoid amulets and charms at all times. The Sunnah is so much that only Dua and Ayat will be recited.
Therefore, in the case of diseases and dangers, it is recommended to recite the Masnoon Du'a described in the Hadith Sharif and take direct treatment and treatment instead of using this method of amulets and charms. This is the safe and correct method."""

We assure you 100% that our farm chickens are produced with complete herbal ingredients instead of antibiotics, growth promoters and other drugs to produce safe chicken meat #herbalchicken which is completely safe for all members of your family. When you usually buy chicken, you keep different parts of the chicken (gills, liver, skin, head, legs). But as a result of raising chickens with the help of herbal ingredients in our farm, the meat of every chicken of #Herbal Chicken is firm and very tasty after cooking. Earlier when we reared chickens normally, we used many unnecessary drugs to increase the weight of chickens before sale, now at the same time we use cumin, fenugreek, chia seeds and some other herbs which reduce excess fat and weight of chickens. But the taste of meat increases several times. The quality and taste of #herbal chicken will change your negative perception about chicken meat. Only one who eats this chicken will understand the true taste and hopefully encourage others to eat this chicken.

"""The place of Thankuni in the world of herbs is very high. Because these leaves have many qualities. Thankuni is a perennial plant. It grows without any care. It grows like a vine above the ground. The leaves are round and grooved. It grows more in damp places. So it is more common on the banks of ponds or water bodies. This is Thankunir.
English name of Thankuni---Indian pennywort. Its scientific name is Centella asiatica urban. In Sanskrit Thankuni is known as 'Brahmi'. But in Ayurveda it is called 'Tvastra'. Regionally this Thankuni is known as Teya, Manki etc. In rural areas, thankuni is cooked and eaten as a vegetable, but this leaf is quite popular in salads or bhartas. Thankuni is rich in vitamins and minerals. It is a great medicine for all types of stomach diseases. It also plays an important role in asthma, asthma, heartburn, toothache, etc.
Thankuni juice is very useful especially on wounds. Thankuni boiled water is good for old wounds.

"""Homeopathic treatment of earache and use of homeomedicine.
👉# What is ear_ripe_rogue?
Otitis media usually refers to an infection of the middle ear. The small cavity behind the eardrum is the middle ear. Otitis media is caused by a variety of infections in the middle ear. It is usually aggravated by a cold or flu. Otitis media is more common in children. It is more common in babies who are bottle-fed. Sometimes bottle milk goes into the ear through the tube. In addition, if the eardrum is leaky, bacteria from the outside can enter the ear and cause an infection. Especially those who get water in the ear while taking a bath are more likely to get this infection. If the infection is inside the ear, the small arteries of the ear become swollen. There is increased secretion and accumulation of pus inside the ear. The infection causes ear pain The patient hears less.
Reason:
• Recurrent upper respiratory tract infections.
• For common cold and influenza.
• When the glands of the oral cavity are enlarged.
• If the tonsils are infected. If there is a tumor at the junction of the nose and throat or if the auditory tube is blocked due to other reasons.
• If you have measles.
• Frequent inflammation of the space between the bones of the mouth and skull (sinusitis)
#Symptoms:
• May cause earache, headache and fever.
• If light shines inside the ear from outside, it will be seen that the eardrum is red. Pus is visible when the membrane ruptures.
• If the eardrum ruptures, pus drains out of the ear (this reduces fever and earache).
• After a ruptured eardrum, the patient hears less in the ear.
Ears are rarely treated in homeopathy treatment.

Is it possible to eliminate metal corrosion without medicine?

But do not know how. Answer There are many delicious food ingredients around us to solve the problem, but we have less idea about these ingredients. Now let's talk a little about the great material.

"""#premature_ejaculation or #rapid_ejaculation is a major problem nowadays. The more modern and busy we are, the more this problem seems to be increasing. Mechanical happiness may be robbing us of mental happiness.
It has been found that 1 in every 3 men face this problem at some point in their life. Many have been suffering from this problem for a long time. But the social system and people do not discuss openly or see doctors for fear of shame. Instead, you are being deceived by the streets and various fake advertisements, and you are wasting your heart, liver, and kidneys by taking this type of sexually stimulating drug.
But there is nothing to worry about. With the right treatment, most patients can quickly return to their daily normal family lives. Let's know about the disease:
What is rapid ejaculation?
Premature ejaculation is when a man ejaculates during intercourse before his partner has reached his preferred stage.
What are the symptoms?
Ejaculation within 1-2 minutes of intercourse or
Unable to hold back ejaculation until satisfied and this results in depression and reluctance to have intercourse.
Types of Premature Ejaculation:
1 Primary or long-term: Those who have a problem from the beginning of life and it has taken a permanent form
2. Secondary or Temporary: A period of life that resolves after a few days. It happens due to various reasons like new marriage, mental stress, physical weakness or any disease.
Reasons include:
Most of the problems are mental, so such problems are called psychosexual disorders.
Besides
*Coitus at a very young age.
*Physical weakness.
*Depression.
*Sexual abuse.
*Overthinking about sexual dysfunction
* Physical diseases and hormonal problems
** Moreover, lack of understanding between couples and each other is also responsible in many cases
Also our Indian subcontinent social system where most men use toilet/bathroom for masturbation. The reason why an agency works is psychologically premature ejaculation, and many men compare themselves to various adult videos and feel inferior. Lack of proper sex education and premarital counseling is also a major factor. Also many are away for work or out of the country, so after a long time meeting with the wife becomes too much tension.
Now let's come to the treatment:
With proper diagnosis, treatment and counseling, in 90-95% of cases, men with premature ejaculation can be given a normal life. So without delay, contact the registered doctor at Aiwadhasha Yagabah and tell your problem, get treatment online and enjoy a healthy married life."""

#Alfalfa is a homeo medicine. Homeopathic mother tincture is more commonly used instead of its fortified medicine. It exerts special action on sympathetic nerves. As a result, nutrition is improved. As a result, appetite and digestion increase. Physical and mental strength increases, along with weight gain of the patient. Its ability to build up weak human tissues due to nutritional disorders is remarkable.
When a person's muscles are weak after suffering from a serious illness, taking it regularly works better than any vitamin or mineral rich medicine.
Its benefits for children are unparalleled. If the child is dry, if the digestion is weak, if the child is getting weak, this medicine will soon remove the weakness and dehydration of the child, increase the digestion power, increase the appetite and at the same time increase the weight of the child.
Many times the child suffers from various diseases due to the deficiency or distortion of the breast milk of the mother who donates breast milk. Medicago sativa or (alfalfa) will increase breast milk by treating nutritional disorders of the mother's breast milk and will help in the physical and mental development of the baby receiving the milk.

Your problem with premature ejaculation is due to prolonged intercourse. And having sex doesn't just cause sex problems, it also kills your sex life.

🛑 Looking for permanent treatment,,,, and want to spend ⁉️ like weekly raw market❗
🛑 What will happen then ❓ will not...
Looking for cheap good things, a class of businessmen are showing flashy ads, in front of you! Advertising, only one file is enough, the price will be refunded in case of failure ❗
🟠 You might be thinking at that time I got this‼️ Last treatment of life❗ Who is stopping me❗ You are happy and the seller is happy❗ You are happy to get the product cheaply❗ And the seller is happy to get a product like you (stupid)❗ Don't take these words personally, I am saying this to hurt someone. No
❎ Well someone tell me if one file is enough for anyone⁉️
I don't know... You may have been a king as long as you drank, and after drinking you became a subject.
Why does this happen?
🚫 Because, by mixing excessive chemicals in that medicine, it artificially increases the sexual power by releasing hormones from the pituitary gland of your brain.
  🚫 Artificially torturing the body causes the bar of your special organ to ring ❗ The special organ loses its own activation ❗
🚫 After being cheated, he abused the medicine seller for a few days and again fell into the trap of some other flashy advertisement❌
  ⛔ This is how your pony horse works! You are moving, money is going, time is also going.
❎ I will not directly blame those drug sellers! The fault is that you find good things cheap. Expensive disease treatment is never cheap, expensive disease treatment has to be done with price❗
⛔ You believe and do not! They have hacked your mind!
They understand what you want. And because they understand, they give you flashy ads, they understand your needs and provide cheap products. And your needs are followed by eating results
🅿️ Set the thought a little, read my words carefully❗
🔰 You go to the doctor with a general bad body or stomach/headache - you spend thousands of rupees on doctor's fees, various tests, medicines. And when you treat an important part of the body, look for cheap. Cheap is not always good, cheap has three conditions❗

👉1/ Suffering from sexually transmitted diseases, but did not take any treatment.
👉 2/ Suffering from sexual dysfunction, has taken many over the counter medicines.
✅ Stage 1 people are much better than stage 2 people. Reason- Being sick is one problem and taking harmful medicines along with being sick is a double problem❗
🛑 Many people may say, brother, I don't take medicine cheaply, I took it at a high price. But it didn't work
There are two reasons behind it not working, if you buy the medicine at a price, it will not be a chemical free healthy herbal product. It takes 5 days/ 7 days or up to 15 days to see results in herbal medicine
And every herbal treatment has a specific course, you have to complete the course by following the rules
⛔ It takes some time to heal the pain that people get when their feet slip even while walking. And you want a permanent solution, but don't be patient! It won't happen‼️You have to be patient❗
❎ There are no shortcuts in life. To get some things, you have to wait for a certain time
🛑 When a tall building is constructed, piling has to be done and after the piling is completed one has to wait for many days to build the superstructure. Buildings cannot be built overnight only if money is available. We have to wait for the foundation of the building to be strong
🔰 To get permanent solution you have to patiently take the medicine regularly❗
🌿 To get permanent solution you need to take any herbal doctor or herbal kabiraj medicine 🍀

🌹 After a long period of married life, it appears in many men that they no longer love their wives. There can be many reasons:-
👉-Not giving proper time to wife.
👉-Not finding novelty in wife.
👉-Do not love your wife from the heart.
👉-Not taking care of your eyes, voice, organs.
👉-Do not give priority only to the wife in your sexual life but bring other people's thoughts to mind.
🌹 Wives also have something to do:-
👉-Do not stay away from husband for a long time.
👉- Before the husband returns home, the wife should be a little tidy, which most people don't do.
👉- Beautiful clothes can be read in front of outside people, on the other hand, in the case of husband, only tattered clothes! In such a case, chaos will come in the world soon.
👉- Finding separate time for husband, which is specific for themselves. """
"(Mephitis) :- Mephitis is used in severe cough like whooping cough, so that the patients get suffocated shortly. Studying loudly, talking, drinking anything increases the cough. When coughing, there is a rattling sound in the chest, the cough lasts all night, it comes back little by little. A strange symptom is that their bodies are so sensitive to heat that they do not experience any difficulty even if they are bathed in ice-cold water; Rather comfortable."
"(Causticum) :- The main main symptoms of Harupikam are urine coming out when coughing, sore throat in the morning, a lot of phlegm in the chest but they cannot be raised, the phlegm that is raised cannot be expelled but is eaten away, burning in the stomach or different parts of the body, Cough is reduced by drinking cold water, urine comes out when you cough, etc. Its mental symptom is that it cannot bear the suffering of others."
"Rumex crispus :- The main symptom of rumex cough is that it increases in cold air. A cough originates from a kind of tickling inside the lower part of the throat or the upper part of the chest. Even if the cold air enters through the nose and mouth, cough occurs, and even if the clothes are removed from the body, the cough occurs, that is, even if the body receives cold air, the cough starts. Covering the whole body including the head with a sheet-blanket-sheet and breathing in hot air only stops the cough. Pressure on the throat or chest increases the cough. Cough is aggravated by talking, taking long breaths, frequent short breaths, or during and after eating."
"(Drosera rotundifolia) :- The main main symptoms of Drosera are severe tickling in the throat, cough that does not stop choking and does not want to stop until vomiting, children hold the chest with both hands due to severe chest pain during coughing, cough increases in the middle of the night. Increases on legs and lying down, coughing turns the face blue, at least ten to fifteen times in the night. Hahnemann forbids frequent feeding of Drosera. Because it can increase the cough and cause danger."
"(Hepar sulph) :- The main main symptom of Hepar sulph is cough increases in cold and dry air, increases by drinking cold water, increases in the middle of the night and in the morning. Hiper is suitable for any cough from mild to severe. But there is no use of hiper in a dry cough i.e. a cough in which there is no phlegm in the chest."
"(Ignatia): Ignatia is a medicine for all strange symptoms. For example, ringing in the ears is reduced by listening to music, piles pain is reduced by walking, throat pain is reduced by swallowing, headache is reduced by bending the head, etc. As the cough increases, Ignatia should be applied if this symptom is present. Generally Ignatia is applicable for any disease due to bereavement, sorrow, grief, separation, failure in love, death of a loved one etc."
"(Ipecac) :- The main symptoms of Ipecac are nausea and clean tongue. From mild cough to severe cough like pneumonia, whooping cough and asthma, you can give epicac if both of the above symptoms are present in someone."
"(Kali bichrom) :- Kali bichrom is an excellent medicine for nose-ear-throat in homeopathy. Its main symptoms are (nasal mucus, vomiting,) the phlegm is very sticky and becomes long like a thread/rope when pulled with a stick (or finger). Any kind of cough or any other disease if this symptom is found, taking Kali bichrome will cure it like magic."
"""<{[ Easy way to keep heart healthy ]}>
Heart is a wonderful engine of the human body. If you want to keep this engine in good condition and live long, eat less or avoid all kinds of animal food and don't eat too much sweets. Fruits are cholesterol free, so eat fruits regularly. Fruits can be eaten even if blood pressure is high. Eat more yellow, orange and red fruits and vegetables. It will be good for heart and brain. OBCT and heart diseases are controlled with the help of fruit fiber. Eating fruits reduces fat and controls body weight.
After the age of 35/40, the blood should reduce the bad cholesterol LDL and increase the good cholesterol HDL. Fats made from sea fish such as olive oil, sunflower oil, corn oil do not allow blood to clot, so if you want to increase HDL cholesterol, you should eat small fish and sea fish, and to reduce bad cholesterol, you should reduce the consumption of red meat, beef, goat meat, egg yolks, brains, etc. or Best left for the elderly. Moderate diet, regular exercise, exercise, moderate sleep (at least 7/8 hours) and adequate rest should be taken. Can't stay up late.
Don't get overly angry/excited. One has to be patient and one has to walk the path in life with increased morale. Stress should be removed, alcohol, cigarettes/tobacco etc. should not be consumed. Lemon, cucumber, tomato etc should be eaten along with eating meat/fatty food. Walk at least 30 minutes daily in the evening. To keep the heart healthy one must keep the mind healthy and lead a normal life. The unsaturated fats in olive oil are beneficial for heart disease. Eating sea fish, Tulsi leaf juice / Tulsi tea, garlic, ginger, onion, lemon regularly and in moderation is good for the heart. Ginger, onion, garlic reduce high blood pressure. Garlic contains A, B, C, D, Calcium, Phosphorus, Iron, Iodine and Antibiotics. Regular consumption of original honey is good for heart health. Control high blood pressure, diabetes and excess weight to keep the heart healthy. Practicing self-religion regularly brings peace to the mind and keeps the heart healthy. Spending time in the welfare of relatives and other people brings joy to the mind and the heart remains normal. Good work brings peace of mind and heart is strong.
If 1/2 of the main 4 major veins of the heart are blocked, animal food should be avoided and regular yoga should be done. Eat heart-healthy fatty foods like olives, peanuts, bananas, soybeans, beans, beans, cucumbers, turnips, green/colorful vegetables, etc. Excess fat in the body can lead to cancer, tumors etc. Egg yolk or white contains no fat. Fruits, wheat, corn, rice, sorghum, almonds, vegetables do not contain fat. Brains, egg yolks, kidneys, liver, butter, crispy fish, beef, pork, etc. contain more cholesterol. Those with heart disease or blockages should avoid long journeys, as long journeys increase heart disease.
If the blockage in the heart artery is detected for the first time or if the blockage reappears after bypass surgery or those who do not have any problems at the moment but want to prevent heart disease, they should do regular yoga, meditation, walk for 45 minutes daily and take cholesterol lowering medicine but avoid meat, big fish. You can get rid of coronary artery blockage by eating vegetables and other curries cooked with and without oil. Thousands of patients are also freed from arterial blockages by God's will through the life changing programs of India's Dr. Bimal Chhajer's Saul and American Dr. Ornish's. Those who can change their lifestyle by doing yoga regularly, meditating, reducing or not eating fatty foods, being stress-free, walking continuously for 45 minutes a day, etc. can stay free of blockages in the Saul (Science and Art of Living) method. The American Pitkin cooking program also plays a major role in curing heart disease. By regularly eating food cooked in Pritikin method, our life expectancy will also increase. Oil, ghee, sugar are avoided in this cooking. So you can use pressure cooker and non-stick frying pan for pretikin cooking. Result of low/high cholesterol levels in the body
Low levels can lead to memory loss, cancer, stroke and infertility. If the cholesterol is more than the desired amount, it can lead to stroke and heart attack due to blockage of heart veins / veins. If you sit for a long time, the blood circulation in the body decreases and the head works less. So do not sit in one place for a long time or sleep unnecessarily during the day. Walking continuously for at least 30-45 minutes daily in the morning and in the evening burns the blood of the body, purifies it and expands the vein/bone, if there is a blockage it can be opened in most cases."""

Any person has a natural aversion (allergy or susceptibility) to any object, namely - egg, crab, shrimp, meat of any particular animal, non-vegetarian or protein food or any special fruit, etc. Taking all these things can cause hives.

🌱 A researcher from the Food and Nutrition Research Institute of the Philippines researched this sajina leaf and said that this sajina leaf is one of the most famous plants in the world.
📍It is known as 'Miracle tree' or 'the tree of life' in many regions for its various properties. If you know about the nutritional content of sajina leaves, you can understand why there is so much fuss about this familiar leaf.
🌱 Sajina leaves are a rich source of nutrients both raw or dried. Dried sajina leaves act as a natural source of nutrients that can be absorbed by our body faster than taking synthetic supplements.
📍According to Optima of Africa, Ltd, 25 grams of sajina leaf powder meets the following portions of a child's daily nutritional needs-
Protein – 42%
Calcium – 125%
Magnesium – 16%
Potassium – 41%
Iron – 71%
Vitamin A – 272%

From this it is very easy to understand that how big role sajina leaves can play in meeting the daily nutritional needs of children. Not only for children, sajina leaves play a role in meeting the nutritional needs of people of all ages.

"[Treatment] : If there is fever, relax the child's clothing or if necessary, immerse him in warm water up to the knees and chest for 5/10 minutes or until the fever subsides, pour cold water on the head and air with an ice bag. When he was about to get upset, he was taken out of the hot water and his whole body was rubbed well with a dry towel and dried: his body should be covered with warm clothes. If necessary, if you do this 2/3 times, the baby's tantrum will go away. If there is constipation, warm water or glycerin suppositories should be given immediately in the anus.

"#Blood_group determination in a very simple way:.
What is required for blood grouping:
1. 3 antibodies of blood grouping - Anti-A, Anti-B and Anti-D
2. A free needle
3. A glass slide
4. Cotton
5. Jibanu Nashak
First, take any finger of the hand whose blood group is to be selected, and after that, take 3 drops of blood on the glass slide by lightly pricking the finger with the needle, keeping the distance according to the instructions given in the picture. After that
Anti-A in 1st drop and Anti-B in 2nd drop
In the 3rd drop, mix Anti-D well with the tip of the needle. Take care when mixing blood and antibody that one does not mix with the other.
Now the rules of blood grouping are:
1. If Anti-A breaks and Anti-B does not break, then blood group is A
2. If Anti-A does not break and Anti-B breaks then the blood group is B
3. If Anti-A Anti-B splits two e's then the blood group is AB
4. If Anti-A and Anti-B do not split, then the blood group is O
We learned group selection
Now select positive and negative
If Anti-D erupts then the blood is +(positive).
If Anti-D does not break then blood —(negative)

The result of the last 6 months of Sadhana
❤❤❤
Oil Details 👉👉👉
Its origin is mainly in the hands of a primitive family. Gradually it became limited to only a certain family. It is not possible to tell the story. In a word, it took several months to fully know its secret ☺☺
👉 I knew about an old man who knew the recipe of long hair oil. It took a long time to find him and get the recipe from him. It is not like the chaldal that you can buy in the grocery store. Even if you have money or the ability to invest, it is very difficult to find it. It took a few months to collect the materials. But I wanted it with all my heart. I ran day and night in search of it. Finally, I got the result of the cost. Alhamdulillah ☺☺☺
This special oil is made with a total of fifty-two (52) ingredients in different amounts. Yes you are listening, #Bayanna T.. And these are not stories or unnecessary guesses, the proof of that can be seen by the number of oil and ingredients arranged on our roof for drying. Each ingredient is allowed to dry kg by kg. There are many rare natural things that have come to us after many efforts. We are not revealing their names for the sake of business confidentiality. The ingredients mixed with it are brought from different villages and towns of our country and various trusted people, which are produced in some foreign countries.
It took a week of painstaking work to sift all the dry ingredients and make the oil. I don't know how many supplies this oil is so effective, but I can say for sure that 100 people out of 100 people will get 100% results by using it, inshallah 😍😍😍
🤫 I can't publish the picture because I can't give it to be more clear.
However, the prices of several of its ingredients are extra high, so we have to keep the price higher
I will upload the packaging and other details very soon☺"""

Regular masturbation causes headaches.
"Newly married? Please read the entire post 🙏 You are having some problems, the main problem is premature ejaculation!
At the beginning of the marriage, it will be out in a few minutes or seconds. Don't be afraid of it
Due to excessive stimulation, or because the sensitivity of the penis is very high, again, this is the effect of prolonged masturbation for many people.
There is no reason to fear, it is not a permanent problem, it will gradually get fixed after some time of marriage.
But you have to be mentally prepared, don't get depressed brother.
You take some necessary steps, Inshallah you will get good results.
Eat fruits (dates, cashew-nuts, grapes, watermelons), eggs, milk, do Kegel exercises regularly (if you search on YouTube, you will find this exercise) and eat raisins, honey, kalijira regularly.
Then you will see a confidence inside you, which is most important.
Start slowly, don't rush. Have more intercourse early in marriage. You will see that all your problems will be solved.
Getting less time the first time?
Delete as soon as you are out, start again, don't take a break in between. You will see a lot of time increase.
Keep your attention elsewhere, or you can call and run (in the opinion of many it works very well) calculate in your mind, pay attention to this side or not.
Condoms can be used to reduce the sensitivity of the penis, which also increases the time.
In general, there are many techniques, which you will gradually understand.
Dear brother, all the best to you, thanks for reading the whole post. Assalamu Alaikum.
