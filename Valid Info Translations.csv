"#blood_and_cough_blood_is_one? Not at all! Vomiting blood and blood in coffee are completely different things. Many people consider these two things as one. In the case of blood in the phlegm, it basically refers to the sticky phlegm and the splash of blood in it. Sometimes this amount of blood becomes more. In the case of blood vomiting, the problem is in the stomach. Sometimes this blood can be black, sometimes it can be of normal color.
Usually, this is due to digestive problems and stomach problems. On the other hand, there is a completely different reason behind coffee blood."

"#Cough_with_blood_when_goes? Basically, if there is bleeding from any part of the lungs and trachea, it comes out through phlegm with cough. Because phlegm originates here. So not only TB or Tuberculosis, but also due to any other reason, blood can come out if the blood vessels of the lungs are damaged. Learn about other causes of bleeding."
#Bronchitis: Bronchitis is an inflammation of the airways. It is easily cured in most cases. But it is very necessary to go to the doctor.
"#Bronchiectasis: This disease causes permanent damage to the airways. In this case, there is repeated infection in the respiratory tract. Because of this, the patient has to suffer almost all his life."
"#Pneumonia: It is an inflammation and infection of the lungs. This disease can be due to various reasons. If you have diabetes, the problem can become more serious."

"#Coughing_with_blood_when_why? Blood is coughed up mainly from any part of the lungs and airways. So if there is bleeding from any part of these parts for any reason, it comes out through cough with phlegm. Because, this is the same region as the origin of phlegm. So not only TB or Tuberculosis, but any cause of damage to the blood vessels of the lungs can lead to bleeding."

"#Vitamin_B6
Sola, eggs, beef liver, fish, spinach, etc"
"#Diagnosis: Some questions are very relevant in diagnosis-  How long has the cough been going on?
 How many days bleeding?
How much bleeding?
How many times a day does this happen?
Has this ever happened before?
 Are there other accompanying symptoms such as fever, chest pain etc.?
Have you ever had TB before?
Is there diabetes?
Are you taking aspirin or clopidogrel for any reason?
Do you have a smoking habit? If so, how long and how much?
If the history can be told correctly, experienced doctors can guess many reasons from it. Tests that are usually done on the patient are:
 Chest X-ray
 CT scan
 Bronchoscopy
 Various tests of fluid obtained from bronchoscopy.
 Sputum test—for TB and cancer
 Biopsy if necessary
Besides, there are routine blood tests
If necessary, endoscopy is also done.
Differences in blood in cough and vomit
In many cases it is difficult to differentiate between coughing up blood (haemoptysis) and vomiting blood (haemotemesis). But with some careful observation it is not difficult to understand the difference—
coffee blood
Blood is bright red.
 Food particles are usually not mixed.
It is accompanied by other symptoms like cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, fever.
Blood in vomit
 Blood is mixed, it is coffee colored.
 In many cases food particles are mixed.
 Accompanied by abdominal pain, loss of appetite, heartburn, sometimes history of black stools.

The same danger is seen in the case of drug users like cocaine. Besides, there is danger of bleeding due to injuries."
"#Cough:- Cough and mucus production are two most common symptoms of bronchitis. Cough is caused by excess mucus production in the bronchial tubes. The color of the mucus is usually white. Bronchitis patients may suffer from shortness of breath. There may be a whistling sound in the chest while breathing and a feeling of pressure in the chest or something heavy being held down. Exercising, climbing stairs, walking briskly etc. can cause problems because during this time our lungs are unable to consume oxygen in proper amount.
       In all these cases, many types of treatment can be done to relieve the discomfort. However, homeopathy is one of the best treatments that will help you get rid of bronchitis quickly and recover from it."

"#Kashtikam :--Frequent dry cough, but with terrible soreness all over the place from the throat to the chest, and this pain is aggravated by coughing. The tone of the throat is hoarse and this hoarseness is more in the morning. As time goes by, it starts to feel less and less."

Chief symptoms — Mucus in throat and chest, cough seems to come up now, but does not come up at all. Cold sweat on forehead, patient panting for difficulty of breathing, unable to expectorate despite abundance of mucus. It is mostly used in children and the elderly, as patients find it difficult to lie quietly on their right side during sleep, often forcing them to turn and sleep on the other side."
"Bronchitis is a common chest infection and can be treated very easily with these tested homeopathic remedies. However, the medicine should be used only after consulting a homeopathic doctor before taking it."

Measles usually appears a few days after the onset of fever. Fever is high on the day of measles outbreak. The patient becomes weak.
Measles, if it appears bloody, bleeds from other parts of the body, including the nose, mouth, eyes, etc. This type of measles is called #hemorrhagic_measles. It is very serious and if not treated properly, the patient often dies.
There are many common sayings in the case of measles patients that in case of measles, the patient is not allowed to eat anything other than potato-filled rice (oil-based food, any type of fried food, eggs, milk, etc.), which can be dangerous for the patient. Give all kinds of food to the patient, but care should be taken that the #bronchitis patient does not get cold. So he cannot be given cold food.
Homeo treatment
Homeopathy treats the patient not the disease. For this reason, an experienced doctor can treat any complex disease including measles according to homeopathic principles by observing individual characteristics and metallic symptoms with God's grace. Such as Acon, Bell, Bryo, Camph, Gels, Ars, Apis, Hepar sulp, Sulp, Morbilinum, Thuja, Opium, Silecea etc. besides other medicines can be used according to symptoms."

People say that if you put rice on your face, you will feel sick, your pulse will be fast, your face and eyes will be red, you will wake up when you fall asleep, you will have a dry cough, and you will cough frequently.

"""#Kidney_Stones_and_Homeopathic_Treatment:-
Kidney stones are now common in many people. It can occur in one or both kidneys. It usually occurs in 30-60 year olds. 15% of men and 10% of women will develop kidney stones at some point in their lives.
In medical terms, kidney stones are called nephrolithiasis. And if the stone causes severe pain, then it is called renal colic.
What are kidney stones?
Your kidneys make urine by filtering waste from the blood. Sometimes salts and other minerals in the urine stick together to form small stones inside the kidney. Kidney stones come in different sizes, shapes and colors. Some rocks are the size of grains of sand. Some can grow to the size of a golf ball.
Diagnosis of kidney stones:
People usually don't feel the need to go to the doctor unless they are in pain. Because of this, kidney stones are usually not detected before the pain starts.
Investment-
After going to the doctor, most of the time the doctor can tell if you have kidney stones by listening to the symptoms.
However, you may need to check a few things.
Urine test to check for kidney infection
Test for passing stones in urine.
Blood tests check if the kidneys are working properly.
The smaller the size of the kidney, the more likely it is to pass out alone. If the size is less than 5 millimeters (1/5 inch), the stone passes on its own 90% of the time. If the stone is 5mm to 10mm in size, there is a 50% chance of passing out on its own.
If the stone size is very large and is unlikely to pass on its own, then you must consult a doctor.
Homeopathic treatment:-
Homeopathy alone is the most successful treatment for treating gallstones without surgery in almost 96% of cases. Homeopathic remedies are able to dissolve gallstones like wax and remove them from the body.

2. Odor in urine.
3. Frequent urge to urinate.
4. Inability to urinate properly.
5. Burning or pain when urinating.
6. Severe pain in abdomen and lower back.
7. Fever in the body with fever and chills.
8. Nausea and vomiting etc.

3. Once a urinary tract infection occurs, there is a risk of recurrence if not treated on time.
4. Those who drink very little water, cannot maintain cleanliness, if this problem continues day after day, they get an infection in their urine.
    The main bacteria responsible for urinary tract infections is E. coli. These bacteria live in the stomach and esophagus. When the immune system is weakened, these bacteria can colonize the reproductive system. When a woman or man does not pass urine at the right time, holding it for hours, E. coli attacks quickly.
5. A catheter (a special tube for passing urine) is placed after major surgery. If the catheter is left in place for a long time and not properly cleaned, it can lead to urinary tract infection. People who have to lie in a hospital bed wearing diapers can also have this problem.

"""#Vitamin-D is one of the leading causes of arthritis nowadays. People of all ages suffer from its deficiency. Let's find out,
What happens in the absence of #vitamin D?
1) Vitamin D deficiency causes rickets in children. Children's legs bend like bows and skulls become enlarged. Suffering from this disease for a long time disrupts the normal growth of the body and reduces immunity.
2) In the absence of vitamin D, jaw structure is not correct, teeth fall out prematurely.
3) Adults have a disease called osteomalacia. In this disease, calcium and phosphorus are lost from the bones of the elderly. Sometimes the pain is felt in the back and spine like rheumatic pain. In many cases the spine is bent.
4) Adults may have osteoporosis or bone loss.
5) Muscular pain.
6) Fatigue and tiredness.

8) Reluctance to dry wounds
9) Hair fall.”"
"“Arthritis
Rheumatoid and osteoarthritis are among the different types of arthritis that are responsible for head and neck pain.
Physical balance:
Yes, your walking or sitting posture is also responsible for back pain in the head and neck. Poor posture creates tension in your back, shoulders and neck. And that tension can lead to headaches. You may also feel a dull tingling at the base of your skull.
Tension:
Excessive tension is the most common cause of headaches. Its effects manifest at the back and right side of the head.
Migraine
Migraine pain can appear anywhere on the head, but most often affects the left side and back of the head.
Low pressure headache
It is better known as (SIH). It occurs when spinal fluid leaks into your neck or back. The leak reduces the cushion of spinal fluid around your brain, causing severe pain in the back of the head and neck
Apart from the above reasons –
• Lack of adequate water intake
• Excessive fatigue
• Not taking meals on time
• Not getting enough sleep
• Infection
The back of the head can be aching due to several other reasons, both big and small."""
"Naturally, in some people, even these reverse DNAs show some similarities. What the pharma companies do is they then develop drugs against those few people who have same cancer. And then, given that drug, some people might benefit. But maximum cancer drugs fail. Can you catch the reason? Because that drug may have been made for the specific reasons of mutation-insertion-deletion etc. of those few people. But for those that don't work, their mutation-insertion-deletion is different. Many cancer drugs fail for this."
"When a cell doubles (replicates), and continues to do so, and cannot be stopped, it is cancer.
When a cell is doubling, its DNA has to be copied twice. Do you know the length of our DNA? 3.2 billion letters (A, T, G, C), each of which has another copy, in each cell (3.2 + 3.2 = 6.4 billion A, T, C, G). There are many complex molecular hypotheses as to why cancer occurs. Some of these say that when a cell is doubling, this DNA is copied incorrectly. Ganjam occurs in the process of ""DNA replication"". Then mutation (mutation), insertion (insertion), deletion (deletion) etc. On the other hand, DN can be wrong. That is, they think, any chemical or ultraviolet rays can damage the cell's DNA. To repair DNA damage, DNA must be modified. And if that repair mechanism is not right, then those cells can transform into cancer cells.
And these events are completely random (of course there are some patterns). These incidents of one person and another person are rarely found. For this, when you test 100 human cancers, you will see that each one has a different mutation-insertion-deletion."
"From what I know about cancer so far (my studies are mainly neuroscience), every person's cancer is different. The symptoms are pretty much the same. From one cell to two, from two to four, from four to eight, the number of cells keeps increasing and increasing. The tumor grows, the tumor bursts, the cancer cells spread throughout the body through the blood, which then becomes malignant. It is called metastasis. Those cancer cells form new tumors wherever they reach. Organs fail, artery veins begin to block, the severity of cancer increases, and the person dies at some point."
"breast cancer
Breast cancer is a type of cancer that develops in breast cells. It is the most common cancer in women worldwide, although men can also develop breast cancer. Breast cancer usually begins in the milk-producing glands or ducts of the breast tissue.
Signs and Symptoms:
Some common signs and symptoms of breast cancer include a lump or thickening in the breast or underarm, change in breast size or shape, nipple discharge, red or flaky skin on the breast, and changes in the appearance of the breast.
Reason:
There are several risk factors for developing breast #cancer including age, family history, inherited genetic mutations, exposure to estrogen and certain lifestyle factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption and being overweight or obese.
Breast cancer treatment depends on several factors, including the stage of the cancer, the size and location of the #tumor, and the individual's overall health."

"🍁Experts or doctors call cashew nuts as ""natural vitamin tablets"". If someone regularly eats a handful of cashew nuts every day, then it eliminates the deficiency of nutrients in the body, along with many other benefits. Today, let's know the benefits of eating cashew nuts.
❇️Incidence of diseases like anemia reduced:
Cashew nuts contain a large amount of iron, which increases the production of red blood cells in the body to such an extent that it eliminates problems like anemia in the body. At the same time, it also increases the immunity of the body. So this cashew nut plays an important role in reducing the incidence of diseases like anemia.
❇️ Removes deadly diseases like cancer:
Cashew nuts are rich in anti-oxidants, which boost the immune system against cancer cells, as well as prevent tumors from forming or invading. Here this deadly disease can be compared to snakes and antioxidants to bees as examples. Cashew nuts contain a substance called promantho-cyanidin, which causes this special function.

These days the eye-catching disease has spread everywhere from the cities to the villages. Eyelid disease is caused by various reasons. Today we will know about the causes and remedies for puffy eyes.
Allergies:
Allergies are caused by foreign particles. These allergies are largely responsible for itchy eyes and subsequent swelling and pain.
Dust:
We are constantly walking on the streets with open eyes in the dust. If excess dust enters the eyes, the eyes are raised.
Polluted environment:
Car smoke, factory fumes and environmental pollution have harmful effects on eyes. This environmental pollution is largely responsible for eye irritation.
Viruses and Bacteria:
Staphylococcus, gonococcus, chlamydia, these bacteria and some viruses are known to cause eye swelling.
Infections inside the eye:
If there is an infection inside the eye due to a personal virus or due to trauma, the eye may become swollen. Parotitis virus, keratitis, herpes simplex virus cause infection inside the eye and subsequently the eye is raised.
Use of Patient Supplies:
One of the reasons for raising the eyes is the patient's use of personal items such as pillows, towels, clothes, etc. Diseases are transmitted through them and a healthy person is affected by eye disease.
Remedies for puffy eyes:
Get up in the morning and wash your hands. Then wash your hands and face with clean water and make sure your towel is dust free and clean. Then wipe your face with a clean towel. Keep all your own towels and clothes separate, so that no one else gets infected from you. There are also some other remedies-

"""To be done when the eyes are raised:
  In recent times, the disease of 'eyes rise' has spread at a large rate in this country. This disease is usually caused by a virus. There is no specific treatment for viral conjunctivitis. It usually heals after several days. Again, as far as I know, there is no preventative measure that can reliably prevent eye twitching. At this time, the following should be done:
  - Stay away from the superstition that if you look at the eyes of a person who has eyes raised, the eyes of a healthy person will also be raised.
  - Using a separate towel or handkerchief to wipe tears or dirt. Do not use unclean handkerchiefs
- Use of dark glasses to protect against dust or external injury.
Avoid rubbing or scratching your eyes without washing your hands.
- If you do not recover within 5 days, moxifloxacin drops and acyclovir ointment can be given as advised by an experienced doctor. Tobramycin ointment may also be used.
- After 5-7 days of lifting the eyes, if you feel problems with vision, you must consult a doctor. It may require various tests. Because, in few cases, this virus can affect the cornea, retina or any other part of the eye. Then there is a problem with vision. But this happens in very few cases.

"""What do you do when you wake up??
It's a responsibility to find a person who has never laid eyes on him. And it's rare that someone in the family has an eye infection but no one else is affected. But there is nothing to worry about when the eyes are raised. In seven to 10 days, the eyelids get better on their own. Especially in our country, the problem of eye swelling is more common in winter weather. However, after lifting the eyes, you must take extra care of the eyes.
Why the eyes??
When the eyes are raised, the eyes become red, with some pain and stinging. It is accompanied by the problem of watery eyes. Eye irritation can be caused by bacteria. Apart from this, due to virus attack, the problem of raising the eyes can also occur. Most of the time the virus is caught in the eye.
Eyes open to understand how
Impure living is one of the causes of eye twitching. Eyes become red due to eye disease. And this happens because the blood vessels of this conjunctiva become swollen and enlarged due to inflammation and increased blood flow. Sticky eyes on waking, constant feeling of something in the eyes, itching and burning of the eyes, discomfort when looking at light, blurred vision, watery eyes, accumulation of dirt (known as Ketur) in the corners of the eyes. , Eye swelling is a symptom of eye twitching.
Let's find out what to do when the eyes are raised
Clear water and water spray
Care should be taken that dirty water, dust, polluted air does not enter the affected eye. Besides, after getting up in the morning, the eyes should be cleaned with water. Many people clean the eyes repeatedly with water or splash water on the eyes. This is not true at all.
Sunglasses
Sunglasses should be worn when going out with the affected eye. It will reduce the burning of the eyes in the sun.
Eye catching disease
Eye swelling is contagious, so contact with those who have eye swelling should be avoided. Handkerchiefs, cloths, towels cannot be used by people with eye problems. Even a handshake can infect others. For this, hands should be washed quickly. Dirty hands should not touch the eyes.
Antibiotic drops
In some cases, a viral attack is followed by a bacterial infection. For this, antibiotic eye drops should be used three to four times a day. It can be used to prevent secondary infections, even if the infection is not bacterial. Antihistamines should be taken if the eyes are itchy. In this case, you must consult a doctor.
Doctor's advice
If the vision is blurry, if the eyes are very red, if it is very itchy or if there is excessive swelling, consult a doctor immediately."""

"
Dengue: Even if the fever subsides, one should continue with the doctor's advice because dengue can occur multiple times."
"
Children should be kept inside mosquito nets day and night. It is especially important to keep newborn babies inside mosquito nets all the time. Besides, if a child comes to the hospital for treatment of other diseases, then he should also be kept inside the mosquito net. Because if an Aedes mosquito bites a Person with dengue and then bites a child, the dengue virus can also spread in his body."
"If the baby's mother is infected with dengue, the virus does not pass into the mother's breast milk. So the mother can breastfeed her baby in affected condition."
"Since dengue is a viral disease, the fever in this disease can usually be 101, 102 and 103 degrees Fahrenheit. However, dengue does not mean that there will be severe fever. Many children are diagnosed with dengue even when the fever is below 100."
"Basically, Dr. Abu Talha divided this fever of dengue into three parts.

First is the febrile phase - when the child's dengue fever lasts for 2 to 3 days or more.
Second afebrile phase - during which the child no longer has a fever. Usually its duration is 2-3 days.

"
The symptoms that are different from dengue when infected with coronavirus are loss of smell and taste, diarrhea, lung infection, difficulty breathing etc."
"On the other hand, one of the differences in the symptoms of dengue is pain behind the eyes, low blood pressure. If dengue is severe, platelets in the blood may drop, and bleeding from the corners of the eyes, gums, or nose may occur."
"
If dengue is severe, bleeding inside the stomach can cause black stools. Women may experience sudden onset of menstruation or heavy menstrual bleeding."
"
If covid and dengue complications occur together, steroids are given for both. There is also an increased risk of giving more steroids."
"If at the same time due to Dengue the blood platelets fall more than the normal level and due to Covid the oxygen level in the blood also falls below 90 then the matter is dangerous. Then at the same time platelets should be given, oxygen should be given. Doctors will decide this."
"
The first step is to get a separate test for both covid and dengue now if any symptoms appear. In case of covid, blood oxygen levels should be measured several times a day with an oximeter at home."
Two types of drugs are needed to prevent viral epidemics. The first is the vaccine. The second is treatment.
"In areas where yellow fever is common and vaccination is uncommon, early diagnosis of cases and immunisation of large parts of the population is important to prevent outbreaks. Death occurs in up to half of those who get severe disease."
Yellow fever vaccine is recommended for Persons aged ≥ 9 months who are travelling to or living in areas at risk for yellow fever virus transmission in South America and Africa
People infected with yellow fever virus are infectious to mosquitoes (referred to as being 'viraemic') shortly before the onset of fever and up to 5 days after onset
The majority of Persons infected with yellow fever virus have no illness or only mild illness.
"No specific treatments have been found to benefit patients with yellow fever. Whenever possible, yellow fever patients should be hospitalised for supportive care and close observation. Treatment is symptomatic."
Yellow fever patients should be protected from further mosquito exposure (staying indoors and/or under a mosquito net) for up to 5 days after the onset of fever.
"Active immunity to Yellow fever is induced by a live, attenuated virus that encourages the development of endogenously generated antibodies. Active immunisation against yellow fever is achieved using the yellow fever vaccine. At least 1000 mouse LD50 units are contained in each dose (typically 0.5 ml)."
"Yellow fever can be prevented with a vaccine - yet it's a disease that claims the lives of an estimated 30,000 - 60,000 people each year."
"In 2016, we vaccinated more than a million people in DRC as part of the Ministry of Health’s response to an outbreak that began in Angola. The outbreak exposed the fragility of the vaccine supply."
"Giving people a fraction of a yellow fever vaccine is effective and could help vaccinate millions more people during emergencies, according to results of a recent study led by Médecins Sans Frontiéres’ (MSF) research arm Epicentre, published in The Lancet."
"This clinical trial marks the first time that all four WHO prequalified yellow fever vaccines have been assessed in the same study. The study used the only four existing WHO-approved vaccines, which are derived from multiple strains of the virus: 17DD (Bio-Manguinhos/Fiocruz, Brazil), 17D-213 (Federal State Unitary Enterprise of Chumakov Institut of Poliomyelitis and Viral Encephalitides, Russia), 17D-204 (Institut Pasteur de Dakar, Senegal), and 17D-204 (Sanofi Pasteur, France)."
"There’s no cure for yellow fever, so prevention is extremely important. A single dose of the vaccine can protect a Person for life. Unfortunately, because it takes about 12 months to produce and it is difficult to forecast the quantities that will be needed each year to respond to outbreaks, there are often shortages of the vaccine."
"Yellow fever is endemic to 34 countries in Africa. Since 2000, MSF teams have responded to yellow fever epidemics in Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) - including in 2015-16 during DRC's largest outbreak in 30 years - Guinea, Sudan, Sierra Leone, Central African Republic, and Chad, among others."

"YF-VAX is a vaccine used for the prevention of yellow fever in Persons 9 months of age and older in the following categories: Persons living in or traveling to yellow fever endemic areas, Persons traveling internationally through countries with yellow fever, and laboratory Personnel who handle virulent yellow fever virus or concentrated preparations of the yellow fever vaccine virus strains."
"YF-VAX should not be given to an individual who has experienced a serious allergic reaction to eggs, egg products, or to any component of the vaccine (including gelatin). A severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) may occur following the use of YF-VAX, even in individuals with no prior history of hypersensitivity to the vaccine components."

"Basically, Dr. Abu Talha divided this fever of dengue into three parts.

First is the febrile phase - when the child's dengue fever lasts for 2 to 3 days or more.

"
The symptoms that are different from dengue when infected with coronavirus are loss of smell and taste, diarrhea, lung infection, difficulty breathing etc."
"On the other hand, one of the differences in the symptoms of dengue is pain behind the eyes, low blood pressure. If dengue is severe, platelets in the blood may drop, and bleeding from the corners of the eyes, gums, or nose may occur."
"
If dengue is severe, bleeding inside the stomach can cause black stools. Women may experience sudden onset of menstruation or heavy menstrual bleeding."
"
If covid and dengue complications occur together, steroids are given for both. There is also an increased risk of giving more steroids."
"If at the same time due to Dengue the blood platelets fall more than the normal level and due to Covid the oxygen level in the blood also falls below 90 then the matter is dangerous. Then at the same time platelets should be given, oxygen should be given. Doctors will decide this."
"
The first step is to get a separate test for both covid and dengue now if any symptoms appear. In case of covid, blood oxygen levels should be measured several times a day with an oximeter at home."

"Monkeypox is an infectious viral disease that can occur in humans and some other animals.[1] Symptoms include fever, swollen lymph nodes, and a rash that forms blisters and then crusts over.["
"Monkeypox is a viral zoonosis (a virus transmitted to humans from animals) with symptoms similar to those seen in the past in smallpox patients, although it is clinically less severe. With the eradication of smallpox in 1980 and subsequent cessation of smallpox vaccination, monkeypox has emerged as the most important orthopoxvirus for public health. Monkeypox primarily occurs in central and west Africa, often in proximity to tropical rainforests, and has been increasingly appearing in urban areas. Animal hosts include a range of rodents and non-human primates."
Monkeypox is a viral zoonotic disease that occurs primarily in tropical rainforest areas of central and west Africa and is occasionally exported to other regions. An antiviral agent developed for the treatment of smallpox has also been licensed for the treatment of monkeypox

People infected with yellow fever virus are infectious to mosquitoes (referred to as being 'viraemic') shortly before the onset of fever and up to 5 days after onset
The majority of Persons infected with yellow fever virus have no illness or only mild illness.
"No specific treatments have been found to benefit patients with yellow fever. Whenever possible, yellow fever patients should be hospitalised for supportive care and close observation. Treatment is symptomatic."
Yellow fever patients should be protected from further mosquito exposure (staying indoors and/or under a mosquito net) for up to 5 days after the onset of fever.
"Active immunity to Yellow fever is induced by a live, attenuated virus that encourages the development of endogenously generated antibodies. Active immunisation against yellow fever is achieved using the yellow fever vaccine. At least 1000 mouse LD50 units are contained in each dose (typically 0.5 ml)."
"Yellow fever can be prevented with a vaccine - yet it's a disease that claims the lives of an estimated 30,000 - 60,000 people each year."

"This clinical trial marks the first time that all four WHO prequalified yellow fever vaccines have been assessed in the same study. The study used the only four existing WHO-approved vaccines, which are derived from multiple strains of the virus: 17DD (Bio-Manguinhos/Fiocruz, Brazil), 17D-213 (Federal State Unitary Enterprise of Chumakov Institut of Poliomyelitis and Viral Encephalitides, Russia), 17D-204 (Institut Pasteur de Dakar, Senegal), and 17D-204 (Sanofi Pasteur, France)."
"There’s no cure for yellow fever, so prevention is extremely important. A single dose of the vaccine can protect a Person for life. Unfortunately, because it takes about 12 months to produce and it is difficult to forecast the quantities that will be needed each year to respond to outbreaks, there are often shortages of the vaccine."
"Yellow fever is endemic to 34 countries in Africa. Since 2000, MSF teams have responded to yellow fever epidemics in Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) - including in 2015-16 during DRC's largest outbreak in 30 years - Guinea, Sudan, Sierra Leone, Central African Republic, and Chad, among others."

"
The symptoms that are different from dengue when infected with coronavirus are loss of smell and taste, diarrhea, lung infection, difficulty breathing etc."
"On the other hand, one of the differences in the symptoms of dengue is pain behind the eyes, low blood pressure. If dengue is severe, platelets in the blood may drop, and bleeding from the corners of the eyes, gums, or nose may occur."
